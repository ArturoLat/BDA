# BDA Repository

This repository is dedicated to the practical assignments of the BDA (Database Architecture) course, showcasing projects that delve into various types of database systems and their practical applications.

## [Introduccio](https://github.com/ArturoLat/BDA/tree/main/introduccio-a-les-practiques-ArturoLat-main)

This section introduces the practical assignments, providing an overview of the course content and the objectives for each project.

## [Practica 2: Bases de Dades Clau-Valor](https://github.com/ArturoLat/BDA/tree/main/bases-de-dades-clau-valor-ArturoLat-main)

In this project, we explore key-value databases, examining their architecture, use cases, and implementation details. The practice includes exercises to understand the storage and retrieval processes in key-value stores.

## [Practica 3: Bases de Dades Documentals](https://github.com/ArturoLat/BDA/tree/main/bases-dades-documental-template-ArturoLat-main)

This project focuses on document-oriented databases, discussing their structure, querying mechanisms, and advantages in handling semi-structured data. Practical exercises involve working with a document database system to perform various operations.

## [Practica 4: Bases de Dades Indexos Externs](https://github.com/ArturoLat/BDA/tree/main/bases-de-dades-indexos-externs-ArturoLat-main)

Here, we delve into external indexing techniques in databases. The project covers the creation and management of indexes to optimize query performance, with hands-on exercises to illustrate these concepts.

## [Practica 5: Bases de Dades de Series Temporals](https://github.com/ArturoLat/BDA/tree/main/bases-de-dades-temporals-ArturoLat-main)

This section examines time-series databases, focusing on their design, storage mechanisms, and typical use cases such as monitoring and IoT data. The practice involves working with a time-series database to store and query time-stamped data.

## [Practica 6: Bases de Dades Clau-Valor](https://github.com/ArturoLat/BDA/tree/main/bases-de-dades-clau-valor-ArturoLat-main)

This project is an extension of Practica 2, where we further explore key-value databases. Note that this section is not finalized and currently contains combined tests from each practical assignment.
